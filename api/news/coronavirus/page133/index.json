EUR/USD surged to a weekly high on Friday amid dollarÂ´s sell-off, retains its short-term bullish stance. The Sterling was among the most benefited from USD weakness at the end of the week, with GBP/USD reaching a two-week high of 1.2485, to close the day at around 1.2450. Dollarâs sell-off triggered a rally, no real reasons for Poundâs strength. Despite the coronavirus (COVID-19) fears, USD/JPY refrains from extending the previous two daysâ declines while rising to 107.95 amid the early Monday morning in Asia. Risk-tone remains under pressure, measures to combat the pandemic in focus. Gold has closed the last full week of a turbulent March around $1,626.The Technical Confluences Indicator is showing that significant support awaits at $1,625, which is the convergence of the SMA 10-4h, the SMA 100-15m. Thanks to swift action worldwide by central banks, global equities avoided a disastrous place, a possible combination of a 1930âs like depression and the 2008 financial crisis.
