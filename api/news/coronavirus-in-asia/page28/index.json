      "excerpt": "The EUR/USD pair closed the week with substantial gains around 1.1140, as the market sold-off the greenback ahead of London’s fix. EUR/USD surged to a weekly high on Friday amid dollar´s sell-off, retains its short-term bullish stance. The Sterling was among the most benefited from USD weakness at the end of the week, with GBP/USD reaching a two-week high of 1.2485, to close the day at around 1.2450. Dollar’s sell-off triggered a rally, no real reasons for Pound’s strength. Despite the coronavirus (COVID-19) fears, USD/JPY refrains from extending the previous two days’ declines while rising to 107.95 amid the early Monday morning in Asia. Risk-tone remains under pressure, measures to combat the pandemic in focus. Gold has closed the last full week of a turbulent March around $1,626.The Technical Confluences Indicator is showing that significant support awaits at $1,625, which is the convergence of the SMA 10-4h, the SMA 100-15m. Thanks to swift action worldwide by central banks, global equities avoided a disastrous place, a possible combination of a 1930’s like depression and the 2008 financial crisis. In just a matter of weeks, massive monetary and fiscal stimulus was injected into the global economy. Note: All information on this page is subject to change.
