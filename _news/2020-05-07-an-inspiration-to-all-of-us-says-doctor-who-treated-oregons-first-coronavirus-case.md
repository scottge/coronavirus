title: "‘An inspiration to all of us,’ says doctor who treated Oregon’s first coronavirus case"
excerpt: "It may be hard to imagine now, but coronavirus didn’t seem like much of an urgent threat at the time. No one in Oregon had the disease and the small number of cases that had emerged in the United States were linked to travel to and from affected countries. The outbreak at a Seattle area nursing facility had not yet come into focus."
