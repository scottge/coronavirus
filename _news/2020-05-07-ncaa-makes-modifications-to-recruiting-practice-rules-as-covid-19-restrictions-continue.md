title: "NCAA makes modifications to recruiting, practice rules as COVID-19 restrictions continue"
excerpt: "Recruiting calls may become a little more crowded in the coming weeks thanks to a new NCAA waiver that will allow current student-athletes to join coaches on recruiting calls. With that ruling, priority recruits may hear not only from Nick Saban but from Nick Saban and Bryce Young — or Dabo Swinney and Trevor Lawrence — as well."
