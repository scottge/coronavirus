title: "Ontario inches closer to allowing more doctor support at long-term care homes"
excerpt: "Ontario removed a hurdle for doctors making trips to the provinceâ€™s long-term care homes to diagnose patients for COVID-19 by promising to compensate them as they would at a hospital, shortly after it had shut down multiple proposals from physicians about how it can help prevent the pandemic-caused catastrophe in nursing homes from worsening."
