title: "Why does Missouri want to be the first to allow concerts, live events during COVID-19?"
excerpt: "Missouri Gov. Mike Parson made national news for all the wrong reasons when the state became the first in the nation to allow concerts and live events to resume this week. Inexplicably, the governor’s “Show Me Strong” economic recovery plan included a woefully premature green light for socially distanced concerts."
