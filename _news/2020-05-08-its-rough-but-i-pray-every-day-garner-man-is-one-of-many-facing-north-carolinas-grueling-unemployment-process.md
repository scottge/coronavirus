excerpt: "895,000 of those claims have been related to COVID-19. \"It's rough but I pray every day,\" said Jeffrey, who was told by the hotels that they hope to be back in June. \"With the help of him above, I sustain and actually get through it.\" Of the more than a million people to apply in North Carolina, less than half of those claims have been approved."
