excerpt: "Quebec has failed to reach its goal of conducting 14,000 COVID-19 tests per day as it prepares to launch a massive testing effort in Montreal, the epicentre of the virus in Canada. Public health authorities say they don't yet have enough staff to rapidly investigate all the patients who test positive and trace the people they may have come into contact with."
