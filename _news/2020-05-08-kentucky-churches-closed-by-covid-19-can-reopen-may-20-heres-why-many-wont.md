title: "Kentucky churches closed by COVID-19 can reopen May 20. Here’s why many won’t."
excerpt: "We will not be opening May 20,” Gilbert said Thursday of his ecumenical church that dates back to 1853. “No pastor wants to race back to church to do more funerals.” Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear has said houses of worship in the state can open May 20 but that doesn’t mean all of them should."
